Biometric-Attendance-Parser

Overview

Biometric-Attendance-Parser is a Java-based application designed to process and consolidate biometric attendance data from multiple Excel sheets into a single, clean output file. The application handles Excel files containing employee attendance records, removes redundant header rows, and merges employee data blocks while ensuring a standardized "Days" row at the top, tailored to the specified month and year.

Features





Input Processing: Reads multiple Excel files (.xlsx) from a specified input directory.



Header Removal: Removes predefined header rows (e.g., "Monthly Status Report", company details, etc.) from each sheet.



Days Row Handling: Extracts or generates a "Days" row for the specified month and year, ensuring it appears only once at the top of the merged output.



Employee Data Consolidation: Stacks employee data blocks from all sheets into a single output sheet, preserving relevant attendance details.



Dynamic Month/Year Support: Prompts the user for the month and year to determine the number of days and generate the appropriate "Days" row if not present.



Apache POI Integration: Utilizes the Apache POI library for robust Excel file manipulation.

Prerequisites





Java: JDK 8 or higher.



Apache POI: Required for Excel file processing. Include the following dependencies in your project:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
    <artifactId>poi</artifactId>
    <version>5.2.3</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
    <artifactId>poi-ooxml</artifactId>
    <version>5.2.3</version>
</dependency>



Input Directory: A directory named input containing the Excel files (.xlsx) to be processed.

Installation





Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Biometric-Attendance-Parser.git



Navigate to the project directory:

cd Biometric-Attendance-Parser



Ensure the input directory exists and contains the Excel files to process.



Build the project using Maven (if using Maven):

mvn clean install

Usage





Place all input Excel files in the input directory.



Run the application:

java -jar Biometric-Attendance-Parser.jar



When prompted, enter the month (1-12) and year (e.g., 2025) for which the attendance data is being processed.



The application will:





Process all .xlsx files in the input directory.



Remove redundant headers and duplicate "Days" rows.



Merge employee data into a single output file named merged.xlsx in the project root directory.

Input Excel File Structure

Each input Excel file is expected to contain:





Optional header rows (e.g., "Monthly Status Report", "Company:", date ranges) that will be removed.



An optional "Days" row specifying the days of the month (e.g., "1 F", "2 St", etc.), which may vary based on the monthâ€™s length.



Employee data blocks containing details such as:





Department



Employee ID and name



Attendance status (e.g., "P" for Present, "WO" for Weekly Off)



InTime, OutTime, Duration, etc.

Example "Days" row for August 2025:

"Days","","1 F","2 St","3 S","4 M","5 T","6 W","7 Th","8 F","9 St","10 S",...

Output

The output is a single Excel file (merged.xlsx) with:





A single "Days" row at the top, either copied from the first sheet or generated based on the user-specified month and year.



All employee data blocks stacked vertically, with redundant headers and duplicate "Days" rows removed.

Example Run

Enter the month (1-12): 8
Enter the year (e.g., 2025): 2025
Merged file created: merged.xlsx

Limitations





Assumes all input Excel files are in .xlsx format and located in the input directory.



The "Days" row generation assumes a standard format (e.g., "1 F" for Friday, etc.) and may need adjustment for custom day abbreviations.



Handles only the first sheet of each Excel file.
